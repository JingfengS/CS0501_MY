<h1>Test with Google Test</h1>
All the tests I wrote for this homework are in the google_tests folder,
zoom in to see the test details.

If you are using clion as IDE, you can choose "Google_Tests_run" as target and click "run", it will automatic run all my tests and you can see the results.
<img alt="clion picture" src="images/clion_target.png"/>
<img alt="test results" src="images/results.png"/>

If you are not using clion as IDE, you can open terminal and switch to the root directory (stack) in this project. And run command:

```angular2html
./cmake-build-debug/Google_tests/Google_Tests_run
```
This will automaticly run all my tests in terminal.

For more information about Google tests, please refer to the link below.
